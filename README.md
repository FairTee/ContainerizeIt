Technologies
Languages: Python, JavaScript
Frameworks: Flask (for backend), React (for frontend)
Libraries: Docker SDK (for container management), Axios (for API requests), Plotly.js (for visualization)
Platforms: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform
Resources: "Docker Deep Dive" by Nigel Poulton, Flask documentation, React documentation
Trade-offs:
 
Backend Framework: Flask was chosen for its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of integration with Docker SDK. An alternative could have been Django, which offers more built-in features, but Flask was preferred for its lightweight nature and better compatibility with Docker SDK.
Container Orchestration Platform: AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform were considered for deployment. Each platform offers similar container orchestration capabilities, but the final decision will be based on factors such as pricing, scalability, and ease of integration with the chosen technologies.

Challenge
Problem: The project aims to simplify the deployment of Docker containers by providing a user-friendly interface for managing containerized applications.
What It Will Not Solve: The project will not address advanced container orchestration features like auto-scaling, load balancing, or fine-grained resource management.
Target Users: This project will help developers and IT professionals who want to quickly deploy and manage Docker containers without dealing with complex configuration settings. Users will include startups, small businesses, and individual developers looking for a streamlined container deployment solution.

Risks
Technical Risks: Technical risks include compatibility issues with different container runtimes, security vulnerabilities in the deployment process, and scalability limitations. Safeguards include thorough testing, regular security audits, and monitoring of system performance.
Non-Technical Risks: Non-technical risks may include low user adoption due to competition from existing container orchestration platforms, legal issues related to data privacy, and financial challenges associated with cloud service usage. Strategies to mitigate these risks involve market research, user feedback, and compliance with data protection regulations.

Infrastructure
Branching and Merging: The team will follow the GitHub flow, with feature branches created for each new feature or bug fix. Pull requests will be used for code review, and the master branch will reflect the production-ready state.
Deployment Strategy: Deployment will be automated using continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines integrated with the chosen cloud platform (e.g., AWS CodePipeline, Azure DevOps).
Data Population: Initial data for container images and configurations will be provided by the user during the deployment process. Additional data may be sourced from Docker Hub or other container registries.
Testing Tools: Unit tests will be implemented for backend logic using pytest, and integration tests for frontend components using Jest and React Testing Library.

Existing Solutions
Similar Products: Existing solutions include Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, and Amazon ECS.
Comparison: Unlike more complex container orchestration platforms, our project focuses on simplicity and ease of use, targeting developers and small teams who need a lightweight solution for container deployment. While Kubernetes and ECS offer advanced features for large-scale deployments, our project aims to provide a more streamlined experience for smaller-scale applications.
Reimplementation Decision: While existing solutions offer powerful features, they may be overly complex for certain use cases. We chose to reimplement a simpler container orchestration solution to cater to users who prioritize ease of use and simplicity over advanced functionalities.
